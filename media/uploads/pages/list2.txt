12. We believe in the healing of the body by Divine power, or Divine healing in its varied aspects as practised in the early Church (Acts 4:30; Romans 8:11, 1 Corinthians 12:9; James 5:14) and by deliverance in the name of Jesus. (Mark 16:17)
13. We believe in the table of the Lord, commonly called the Communion or the Lord's Supper, for believers. (1 Corinthians 11:28-32; Matthew 26:26-28)
14. We believe in the reality and personality of the Devil and eternal judgment in the Lake of Fire for the Devil and his angels. (Matthew 25:41; Revelation 20:14-15)
15. We believe in eternal life for believers (John 3:16, 5:24), and eternal punishment for the unbelievers. (Mark 9:43-48; 2 Thessalonians 1:9; Revelation 20:10-15)
16. We believe that there is one true universal Church, made up of genuine believers, but this one universal Church is also composed of many local Churches in given localities. These Churches are under the sovereign headship of the Lord Jesus Christ, exercising autonomous authority under Him, administering all its local affairs and ministry, as well as the propagation of the gospel. (Acts 15:22; with Matthew 16:18, 18:15-20)
17. We believe that Government is ordained of God, and the powers that be are ordained as ministers of God to us for good. To resist the powers and the ordinances is to resist to ordinance of God. We are subject not only for wrath sake but for conscience sake, rendering to all their dues, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour. We declare our loyalty to our Government and its leaders and will assist in every way possible consistent with our faith in the scriptures as Christian citizens.(Romans 13)
